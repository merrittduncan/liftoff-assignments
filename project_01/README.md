# Capstone Project Plan

## Overview

There is a need for an easy-to-use and simple website specifically for sewing, a hobby that has seen recent growth along with a demographic shift. Over 1 million people have taken up sewing in the past three years, most of them young, tech-savvy women. Currently, many sewists use ad hoc spreadsheets on Excel or Google Sheets, or general note-taking apps such as Trello or Evernote to keep track of their collections of fabrics and patterns. My website will help sewists organize their collections, to aid in planning projects and purchasing decisions. It will allow users to upload photos and details of their fabrics, so each fabric "card" will display information like material type, yardage in collection, primary color or style of pattern and washing instructions. There will also be a database of patterns, built primarily through user input, categorized by garment style, pattern maker and suitable fabric. Users can add a pattern to their collection or to a wishlist. A seperate queue will allow sewists to pair together patterns with a fabric choice for planning their next project.

## Features

* User Login - users will have a private database of patterns and fabrics.
* Search - users search through patterns already available on the site, as well as searching through their own collections
* Add New Card - users can create and edit fabric, project and pattern cards

## Technologies

* HTML & CSS
* Javascript
* PHP 
* MySQL


## What I'll Have to Learn

* How to maintain and create databases - I currently use some SQL for my job so I think I would prefer to stick with that but not sure how valuable/in-demand that skill might be - or if there is a better choice.
* Uploading photo capability - capturing photos of fabric is integral to the website, so allowing users to do so within the creation of their fabric card is essential and the easiest route would be accessing a user's camera on their phone
* Making the site mobile-friendly - styling the website so it is easy to use on all platforms, especially mobile
